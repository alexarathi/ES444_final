<h2> Thesis: In the long term only impactful investments survive. While there may be temporary opportunities in the market for expliotive businesses, external stakeholders eventually close these opportunities. Unfortunately, quarterly earnings and CEO turnover creates and environment for management to be incentivsed to focus on short term not long term. The solution is to provide patient capital to allow management to prioritize long term over short term profit. </h2>
